# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

V. Isualize asked for a summary of ride-sharing data from PyBer that analyzes weekly fares based on city type: Urban, Suburban, or Rural. To complete the analysis we were given two csv files and were asked to create a dataframe summary and a line chart showing this weekly breakdown from January 1, 2019 - April 28, 2019.

## Results:

As you can see from the data frame and the line chart visualization, the weekly fares for city types is rather different. Total weekly fares are the highest in urban areas, followed by suburban areas with rural areas having the lowest total fares each week. This makes sense when you think of population density in these areas, with urban areas having more individuals taking rides. The total_rides_by_type DataFrame showed that Urban City types had 1,625 total rides compared to rural city types only having 125 total rides. The average rural fare is also more expensive than then average urban fare at $32.62 and $24.53, respectively.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

Based on the results of the PyBer Analysis I would recommend incentivizing rides in Rural and Suburban areas to increase the number of users and the demand for ride share access. This should then increase profits, allow fares to be lower, and increase the total ride count in rural and suburban areas.

Drivers in Urban cities are making much less in average fares than drivers in rural cities. Specifically, drivers in rural cities are making  70.14% more than drivers in urban cities. Urban locations are generally more expensive to live than rural areas, so this seems like it would be a problem for PyBer Drivers in urban areas. If the total number of drivers was decreased, drivers would earn more money and lessen the salary gap between urban and rural drivers.

While drivers make 70% more than urban drivers, urban fares are only 30% less than rural fares. Trying to level out those percentages would help to decrease the disparities between urban and rural drivers and the fare differences.
