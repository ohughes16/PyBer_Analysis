# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

V. Isualize asked for a summary of ride-sharing data from PyBer that analyzes weekly fares based on city type: Urban, Suburban, or Rural. To complete the analysis we were given two csv files and were asked to create a dataframe summary and a line chart showing this weekly breakdown from January 1, 2019 - April 28, 2019.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

As you can see from the data frame and the line chart visualization, the weekly fares for city types is rather different. Total weekly fares are the highest in urban areas, followed by suburban areas with rural areas having the lowest total fares each week. This makes sense when you think of population density in these areas, with urban areas having more individuals taking rides. The total_rides_by_type DataFrame showed that Urban City types had 1,625 total rides compared to rural city types only having 125 total rides. Teh average rural fare is also more expensive than then average urban fare at $32.62 and $24.53, respectively.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
